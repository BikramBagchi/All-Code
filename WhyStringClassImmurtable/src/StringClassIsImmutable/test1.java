		//Why STring is immutable and Final
		
		/*
		 Immutable means unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
		 
		 Suppose we have two String
		 
		 String s1 = "Java";
		 String s2 = "Java";
        
        So in memory it will take java and for java it have two 
        reference one is s1 and another one is s2.
        
       Now if String become immutable then when we 
       
       s2 = "C++"
       
       then for s1 it will also change the value to C++
		 to over come String made as immutable or final
		 by default nature
		 
	   when we change the value of s2 the it will only 
	   change the value for s2 not for s1
	   s1 value will remain as java
	   
	 One more advantage is that if hacker hack and change 
	 some path or the main database name then it will 
	 not effect the whole application.
