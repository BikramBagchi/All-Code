		 Suppose i am a Polymorphoism because my behavior change

		 my behavior change. When I was at night party my behavior 
		 when I am with my girl friend my behavior get change.
		 
		 So when a person or a object change it's behavior
		 from time to time we call it Polymorphoism

	      What is compiler
	      
	      A compiler is a computer program that transforms computer 
	      code written in one programming language (the source language) 
	      into another programming language (the target language).
	      Compilers are a type of translator that support digital 
	      devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is primarily
	      used for programs that translate source code from a high-level 
	      programming language to a lower level language
	      (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) 
	      to create an executable program.[1]

		/*
		 What is static Polymorphoism
		 
		 In Java, static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading. 
		 Method overloading means there are several methods present in a 
		 class having the same name but different types/order/number of 
		 parameters.

		/*
		 What is dynamic polymorphism 
		 
		 As the method to call is determined at runtime, this is called
		 dynamic Polymorphoism or late binding
		 */
	    
		/*
		 Why downcasting is not possible in java
		 
		 it is not possible because in java we can't have the child 
		 class in the left hand side.
