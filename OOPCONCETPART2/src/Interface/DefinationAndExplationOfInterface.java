	  How to do multiple inheritance the answer is very 
	  simple and that is interface
	  
	  	   So what is interface
	  	   
	  	   suppose ICICI bank want to branch in USA
	  	   so USA government said you have to maintain some rule and 
	  	   regulation and all the rules are already defines 
	  	   in a interface (So different rule means different method)
	  	   
	  	    Here ICICI Bank is a class
	  	    
	  	    In Interface a child class can implement multiple 
	  	    inheritance 
	  	    
	  	    to create a interface right click on package 
	  	    and the navigate to new and select Interface
	  	    
	  	    it will generate with keyword a interface
	  	    
	  	    Their is not main method interface
	  	    
	  	    **In interface we don't give the method body only method definition
	  	    *that means only declaration of method 
	  	  
	  	  	 */
		
		/*
		 Different properties of Interface 
		 1)Only method declaration 
		
		 2)No method body or only method prototype
		   
		   public void test()
		   {
		   
		   }
	      	 
	      	so to open the { will give error 
	      	
	      3)In interface we can declare the variable 
	      4) Variable are by default static in nature
	      5) Variable will not be changed  
	      6) No static method in interface 
	      	
	      	public static void transfermoney(); will give error because
	      	interface is a part of OOP so it is a part of object and 
	      	object can't have a static method
	      7)No main Method in interface
	      8)Interface are abstract in nature that means we can't
	      create the object of interface
	      9)
