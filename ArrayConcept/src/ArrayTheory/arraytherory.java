	 //Duplicate variable is not possible for java
	 // we can take i= 30 so now i change to 30 but i is no more 10
	  // so to store more that 1 value at a time for i we use array
	  // array : to store similar data type values in a array variable
		
      //Advantages of array
// multiple values in single variable with similar data type

//Disadvantage of Array
//1)Size is fix
	  //suppose I have 4 subject for the whole year and i store their name as string array
	  //Now after few day total subject change to 6 so now now we can't 
	  //do s[5] as it will give us an error index out of boundary 
//2)It stores only similar data types value 
// it means it can only store int or string or char or boolean or char but not a combonation of all these data type and String Class.
	  
/* to overcome the disadvantage 1 we use collection */
/* to over come the disadvantage object array */
