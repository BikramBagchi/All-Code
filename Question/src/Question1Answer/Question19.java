		 What is the difference between Run time error and 
		 compile error
		 
		 Compile time error is any type of error that prevent
		 a java program compile like a syntax error, a class 
		 not found, a bad file name for the defined class, a
		 possible loss of precision when you are mixing 
		 different java data types and so on. A runtime error 
		 means an error which happens, while the program is running.
